Possessive pronouns are used to show ownership. They replace the noun and make sentences less confusing.

The possessive pronouns are:
- i -> mine
- you -> yours
- he -> his
- she -> hers
- it -> its
- we -> ours
- they -> theirs

### Difference between a pronoun and an adjective?

This **cell phone** is **my cell phone**, it is not your **cell phone.**

You can see in this sentence we say three times cell phone, the sentence is correct, but it does not sound good

Look at the sentence again, now with possessive pronouns.

This **cell phone** is **mine**, it is not **yours**
- **mine** substitutes 'my' (p. adjectives) 'cell phone' (noun)

**PERSONAL PRONOUNS**  
They are used instead the nouns

**POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES**  
They need to mention the thing that is possessed.

**POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS**  
They donÂ´t need to mention the thing that is possessed.
