### What is?
An imperative sentence is **a sentence that expresses a direct command**

> Examples:
- Affirmative:
- *Close*, the door, Ana. There's a lot of noise outside.
- *Stand* up.
- *Turn off* your cell phone.

- Negative:
- *Don't eat* in class.
- *Don't play* with your call phones.
- *Don't be* late.

We use imperatives to give **orders**, **directions** and to make **requests**. To sound more polite, you can add the word _please_ at the end or at the beginning of the sentence.

- Open the window, please. 
- Please show me your homework.

### When to use it?
We use the imperative to give orders, commands and directions.
