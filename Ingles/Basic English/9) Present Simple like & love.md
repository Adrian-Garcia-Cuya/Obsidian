The preset simple is used to talk about your routines, habits and facts. For example:
**Routine:** I like to take a bubble bath in the morning.
**Habit:** I love singing in the shower every day.
**Fact:** Water evaporates at 100°

### Explication
Sometimes the verbs give you the complete idea -> "I run in the mornings."
Here we know that the person is **running**.

Sometimes you need to have more information in the complement to make your sentence logical.
For example, you say "I like",  but... **what?**. For the sentence to be clear, you need more information.****

When you use the verbs “like” and “love,” it is necessary to provide more information. When that information is an action, there are specific rules.

### Actions after "like" and "dislike"
Every time we use the verbs “like” and “love” we have two options, and both of them have the same meaning.

Verb
**Infinitive "to"** -> I like to paint / I love to paint
or
**Gerund "-ing"** -> I like painting / I love painting
