### What is?
The possessive case is a grammatical construct.

### When to use it?
It is used when we want to show *a relationship of ownership, possession, or close association between two nouns or pronouns*.

### Rules

- **A noun goes before the apostrophe 's'**:
- The children’s room is upstairs.  
- Mario’s backpack is dirty.
- My father’s car is white.

- **If the meaning is clear, we can use without a noun after it**:
- My house is smaller than Steve’s. (Steve’s house)
- Is this your car? -> Yes, it's mine.
- Whose book is this? -> It's hers.
Here the answer omits the noun, which is someone's property, because in the context it is clear what they are referring to.

- **When we talk about a thing the preposition ‘of’ is used**:
- The leg of the table.
- The windows of the house.
