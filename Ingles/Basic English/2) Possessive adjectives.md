### What is?
Possessive adjectives are words used to show possession - always followed by a singular or plural noun.

**Possessive adjectives** and possessive pronouns can be confusing. Remember that a possessive adjective is located **before the word that it describes**. Whereas, a **possessive pronoun is used in place of a noun.**

### When to use it?
We use it when we want to show property, a sense of belonging or ownership to a specific person, animal or thing. They do not have male and female versions– gender.

### Possessive adjective
- I -> My
- You -> Your

- Her -> She

### Rules

#### Position of the possessive adjectives
Like all adjectives in English, they are always located before the noun they refer to.

**Possessive adjective** + noun

| **Example:** | My house  |
| ------------ | --------- |
|              | Your book |
|              | Their car |
#### Possessive adjective agreement
The possessive adjective needs to agree with the possessor and not with the thing, animal or person that is possessed.

**Examples:**

- My house is big (“I” is the subject that possesses a home).
- Her husband works in a bank (“She” is the subject that possesses a husband).
- His mother is a teacher (“He” is the subject that possesses a mother).

#### Possessive adjectives with plural or singular nouns
The form of possessive adjectives is the same with plural or singular nouns

- Our car is expensive (a singular thing).
- Our cars are expensive (plural things).
